# Scientific Literature Extraction and Analysis

This project aims to extract massive volumes of scientific literature via scrapers and/or APIs, map them using network science and graphs and analyze their full texts in order to filter and classify them, possibly using the methodological approach of Evidence Gap Maps (EGMs) from the International Initiative for Impact Evaluation (http://www.3ieimpact.org/evidence-hub/evidence-gap-maps).

Foundational papers are also available in the repository.
